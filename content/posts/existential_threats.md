Climate change, poverty and inequality  
What do all of the biggest issues we are facing have in common? 
First, they all are pretty darn complex. Bigger than individuals or communities, even bigger than countries. But more importantly, we as humans play an important (if not, the most important) role in it. 
That raises the question: What does it mean to be human in this day and age? 
A world that is increasingly shaped by technology, with a society that primarily focuses on unrestricted growth and the highest of expectations. 


To work towards solving some of these issues, we have to look to ourselves. What do we want, what do we need, what do we have to sacrifice. 
how can we work towards real sustainability, where we live in balance again with nature and the world.
We are adaptive, we are inventive, but also have lost touch with our environment.  
 
create a balance in the world, sustainable, fulfilling,  fair living and equal opportunities.
