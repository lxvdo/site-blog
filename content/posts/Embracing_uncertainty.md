It’s been ten months since I left the Netherlands to set out on this journey. In all this time I’ve gone halfway around the world, and three quarters around the sun. With a load of experiences under my belt, it’s about time for some reflection. 

Starting out on this trip, I had no idea where it would take me. I had a train ticket from Moscow to Beijing, that was about it. Not having a plan scared me. With so many unknowns, what was going to happen? What did I get myself into? 

## Shifting your mind from fear to excitement
The mind thinks and the mind overthinks. The unknown is scary. As a survival instinct, our ancestors used to approach everything unfamiliar with great caution or even try to avoid it. It could be dangerous, threatening their livelihood. Or they had the fear it could alienate them from their tribe. 
Today’s society has overcome most of these dangerous situations. Human evolution, however, has yet to catch up, as our primal instincts still linger in our minds and bodies. 

With biology as a given, the challenge is up to you to learn to cope with your instinctive feelings of fear and anxiety. That only happens when you start exposing yourself to the novel, the uncertain and the unknown. It’s an exercise of the mind, to stop listening to your inner monkey and to start doing. 
Begin small and find out that you were stupid for being afraid. Discover that in most cases, failure isn’t the end of the world. Failure can be your best teacher. Experiment without expectation, focus on the process and allow yourself to be wrong. 
In the end, you’ll see that the only real failure is in not taking any action and in not learning from the experience, regardless of its outcome. 

After every experience you grow a little more confident, stretching your comfort zone bit by bit. You start interpreting the feelings of fear as feelings of excitement. Then, it is key to keep the momentum and go a little bolder, or to take the challenge to a different dimension of your life. 

## Discomfort away from home
Solo travel is one of the easiest ways to put yourself in the unknown and the uncertain. You are left to your own devices. You have to decide and figure it out. You pick the path and set out.

With an abundance of information available nowadays in travel guides, blogs and videos, you could plan your whole trip to the smallest details. Doing that, in my view, takes away from the experience. Of course, it can be useful to view these sources for inspiration and to give you a starting point.  
But I keep it at that. I don’t have a bucket list. I know I’m not going to miss out if I don’t see Lonely Planet’s top 20 attractions. Popular opinion does not have to equal your own. I’m not eyeing for selfies, I look for experiences and connections along the way.  

I don’t have a plan. I’ve found that the most fulfilling experiences in travel and in life cannot be planned for. No travel guide can show you where and to who you will connect the most. 

So venture out. Listen to yourself and follow your curiosity. Allow for some randomness by taking chances, you might just surprise yourself. Use uncertainty and discomfort as your compass. Feel the fear and take it head-on, seeing it as the path of excitement and growth. 

## Travelling to (re)connect and grow
I don’t have the idea that you are going to find yourself whilst travelling. I don’t think you will ever completely find yourself. You can become more conscious of where you stand, but you will always keep some undiscovered depth. 
I do believe that your identity, your sense of self, is shaped by the experiences you have and the things you learn. It’s in constant flux and it will remain so until the day you die. 

I set out with the goal to learn and grow by connecting. I wanted to connect more to nature, to others and to myself. To go out of my routine and into unfamiliar environments, allowing me to create new bonds and to strengthen the ones I’ve neglected in the past years. 

The Netherlands doesn’t have a lot of [untouched nature](https://soundcloud.com/de-correspondent/jan-van-poppel-met-dit-beleid-houden-we-geen-natuur-meer-over) left. It then only makes sense to seek it across the borders. In these months I’ve climbed mountains, hiked through jungles and steppes, dived into the underwater world, and bested blizzards and typhoons.
Exposing myself to these primal environments reinforced my appreciation for nature, finding intense beauty and inspiration. On the other hand, I’ve also been confronted with the fact that humans have had a disastrous impact on nature. It worries me that we will lose a lot of beauty and diversity if we don’t change our ways. 

I‘ve not lost faith in humanity though. Connecting with people from all over the world and with quite different backgrounds, I feel that most people want similar things in life. And for the most part, it’s the simple things that bring the most fulfilment. We have our cultural differences and beliefs, but our shared goals and shared adversity bring understanding and empathy. They give perspective, prompting you to be grateful, to give and share, and to reconsider your ways.

Finally, I’ve been reconnecting with different parts of my self. I’ve noticed that it’s comfortable to follow the path that society sets out for you, growing up, getting an education, a stable job, a house and a family. But I started wondering: are these decisions that I have consciously taken myself? Are they things that I still want now?
The more stories you hear of different people’s lives, the more you become aware that there are many ways to design your life. It’s again about daring to choose your own path. 

So along the way, I tried to go back to the essence. My essence. To redefine my values and to reconsider what I’m passionate about and who is important to me. To use these principles as the foundation of everything I do.

One of the exercises I did was to reflect on your life as a child. You reconsider what you liked doing before the world started expecting things from you. It could guide you to things you might have lost, but would still very much enjoy. And help you find your inner child. 

## The never ending journey
I’m not there yet. The journey is never ending. But two important things that I’ve found along the way is that I’m passionately curious about learning how everything works and that I get joy and satisfaction from the process of creating. 

Writing is something where these two can come together. Writing consists of researching, learning, arguing and creating. It’s about solidifying the concepts and ideas I’ve taken up along the road, by finding clarity. Sharing to get feedback and to inspire thinking. 
It’s one of the endeavours I’m experimenting with in the coming period and will share with you along the way. 

Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear what you think so far!
