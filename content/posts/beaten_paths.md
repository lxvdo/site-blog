in the past few years i have more and more been reading and thinking about the world.
what is normal, why do i choose a certain thing instead of the other? 
from a young age a path is set out for your, from primary to secondary school to high school to university to working life as an employee.
Did I choose this myself? Or is this something that is imprinted on me from a young age. Be a working cog in the larger machine the human society, and dont question the status quo. 
Am I not grateful for the privileged life I'm living?
