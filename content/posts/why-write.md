Thinking vs communicating( writing, drawing, speaking)

writing worries of publishing

## structure and externalise thinking
solidify your thoughts

reflection

feedback, improve, correct

## remember, memory
worry less

learn from your past,
travel back in time

combine ideas

## take action, apply lessons
log what you want to do/apply

log what you did

learn from your actions and mistakes

create versus consume

## to share
Help, inspire, influence

## to connect
vulnerability, intimacy

Writing for the self
Writing for the world


Action:
journal
idea notebook
blog

No need for structure

write one meaningful sentence each day
