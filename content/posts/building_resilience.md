It’s strange how life can change in a matter of days. From exploring the other side of the world to finding myself back in the country and home I grew up in. I’m not sad. I don't need to be. It’s the best place I can be at this moment. I’m grateful for the means and services we have here to fulfil our basic needs, even during a global crisis. 

People call it a time of great uncertainty. Uncertainty has always been there, but only now it’s becoming more apparent to a lot of us. It’s affecting our way of living, interrupting our routines and halting our economy. 

We don’t know what will happen, how long it will take for things to get back to normal and if our sense of normal will have to change. What we do know is that humanity has been through worse, that we can adapt and overcome more than we think, and that periods like these tend to be temporary. It’s just going to take time and there are no guarantees. We need to be patient.    

## What can you do?
It’s a tough period if your own or your loved ones’ health is affected, or if you’re a healthcare worker. I wish you all the strength. 

For everyone else, focus on the things you can influence. Staying safe comes down to remaining calm, following measures to limit the spread (staying at home, social distancing) and being up to date with your government's policies. It’s a small price to pay for your own and others’ wellbeing. 

With a lot of your routine activities being cancelled or forbidden, you probably have some extra time at hand. Even taking all the safety measures, there still is an abundance of things you can do. 

If you see an opportunity to help people in need around you, by all means, go for it. 
Other than that, keep doing your work to the best of your abilities, because the world is not ending. Even though there is a lot of focus on the COVID-19 crisis, all of humanity’s other challenges haven’t disappeared and require some of our time and attention as well.  

This is not the first crisis we find ourselves in and it certainly isn’t going to be the last either. We should expect more economic downturns, environmental disasters, and the possibility of automation of jobs.

With these uncertain challenges lying ahead in the future, your best bet is to become more resilient. Strengthening your mind and body and acquiring the tools to adapt effectively to changing circumstances is the best preparation in the face of unpredictable adversity. 
I focus on three interconnected aspects of resilience: mental, physical and financial.

## Building Mental and Emotional Resilience
In today’s world, we are in constant connection, bombarded by noise, distractions and temptations. It’s hard to focus and find out what’s relevant. We juggle our work, social and private lives. We end up feeling unfulfilled in at least one of them. We face adversity and uncertainty. We don’t know how to respond or act and are getting stressed. 

With so much happening, how do you stay sane and find clarity? I work on four aspects:

* __Adopt a resilient mindset__ to frame uncertainty in a more constructive way; I combine a mindset of growth with concepts of stoicism. 
I choose to accept what I cannot change and focus my efforts on things I feel I can influence. 
I cannot control all the outcomes, but I can put in my best effort and learn and grow from it anyway. 
This mindset might not be fully compatible with you. But at least, you can take some time to dive into a little philosophy or personal development content and find something that does work for you. 
* __Balancing out consumption with creation__; Even in these times, I try to limit the amount of content that I consume. 
You might feel powerless in the face of this uncertainty and want to know more, but at the moment no one knows things for certain. 
Watching and reading the news all day long is not going to change anything. 
Instead I focus on creating more, as it’s stimulating your brain, giving you fulfilment and energy. Everyone is a creator: You can write, cook, draw, paint, build, code, make music, dance, sing etc. Try out new things to express and enjoy yourself.  
* __Finding positivity and joy__; Even in the roughest of times, we can find positivity and joy. People are using creative ways to connect, have a laugh and enjoy the simple things in life. They are calling their friends and family more than ever, and are finding new interests to occupy their minds. Give to others, and also give yourself a break. Do things you enjoy, just for the fun of it. 
* __Practicing reflection__; You need to reflect and work through your mind’s inner struggles and conflicts. Otherwise, limiting thoughts and emotions start building up until you burst. Now’s a perfect time to try and find how you can reflect better on yourself and cope with difficult situations. 
It can be talking to someone you trust (or conversely, to a total stranger), writing your thoughts and feelings down and working them through, or practising mindfulness meditation. 

## Being Physically Well
In our hectic daily life, we often don’t seem to find the time to take proper care of our own body. This leaves us weak, fragile to misery and disease. Being healthy is not going to make you immune to disease. You can still get hurt, and your body is still susceptible to viruses and bacteria. However, by being fit you give your body the best shot at fighting off illnesses effectively. You can recover quicker and/or have milder symptoms. 

Then again, being healthy is also about feeling full of energy, allowing you to tackle both physical and mental roadblocks. You boost overall performance in all aspects of life.

You can use this time to start prioritizing your wellbeing:

* __Breathe__; We do it all day long and take it for granted. It’s also one of the most effective and easiest tools to reduce stress. It's one of the essential parts of mindfulness and meditation for good reason. Even if you are not into that, you can still use something as easy as the [double inhale, extended exhale (backed by science)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-iajrGH-EO/).
* __Sleep__; We all need sleep to recover from our daily struggles, but most of us are probably not getting enough. Have a look and find out how you can get more quality sleep.  
* __Eat__; We live in a world of abundance and are constantly tempted, which causes struggle. On the other hand, finding out what healthy eating looks like isn’t easy either.
 It isn’t an exact science, there are no holy grails. People react differently to foods and have varying needs. In most cases, it comes down to having a sufficient variety of nutrients, in the right quantity for you. So that means experimenting. Also, know that your body changes as you age, so what might have suited you in the past doesn’t have to be valid anymore. I’ve tried to make it simple for myself by setting up basic rules of eating, which I will go into in a later post. 
* __Move__; We are not static creatures, we were not evolved for sitting inside still all day long. Our bodies need to and want to move. It energizes and strengthens us. Find activities you enjoy doing. Do some stretching. Go outside for a walk. Create your own indoor or garden gym. But keep it safe:) 
* __Sense__: A lot of us are out of touch with our bodies. Things are bothering us, but we often don’t know exactly what. Instead of ignoring, sedating or treating symptoms, start listening to your senses again. Explore to find out what the real cause is. Do your research, consult with experts and experiment. 

## Becoming Financially Secure
There is no denying it, you need money to function in society. This fact does not have to limit you though. Find that you don’t need a lot. Furthermore, there are more opportunities than ever to earn money, even in the most unconventional ways.  

This crisis shows that a lot of people are not financially secure. It sucks to be without a job or have a halted business, but living in a wealthy country means you’ll probably have support to get through it. You can and should learn from it. Having just one job or income stream is putting all your eggs in one basket. 
Instead, start to diversify and be prepared for when times get rough again.  

Achieving this is going to take time. Start by creating a plan that takes you in the right direction. What you can think of: 

1. Getting rid of debt; It’s the one big thing that’s dragging you down. An exception in some cases could be a mortgage or business loan, but do the math and know what’s important to you.   
2. Find out how much you are spending and how much you actually need. Put some money on quality and things you enjoy, but stay lean in general. 
3. Start building up a buffer to cover sudden unforeseen costs and at least three to six months of living expenses. 
4. Invest both time and money in your development of universal skills and knowledge. They complement what you already possess and are the things that are going to keep you relevant in any future scenario. 
5. Diversify your income by building up additional income streams. You can invest your money in different ways, and you can create value in different ways. Start with your experience and skill set. Get creative. Ask yourself, in which other places could I provide value with my expertise? 

## What I’m doing
During the past years I have been working on my resilience in varying ways. For instance, even though I didn’t consider myself a spiritual person, during my trip I found how I can practically apply mindfulness to find inner peace and clarity. I’ve been moving a lot more every day, got more conscious about my diet and have become a vegetarian. 

For now, I focus on things that bring me joy. Reconnecting with people I care for, following my curiosity and learning more about sustainability and the mind. I’m balancing out my consumption of content with several creative activities, including writing, programming and learning to play the piano. 

Finally, I’m exploring in what ways I can best contribute towards building a sustainable future and earn a living of that as well. If you’ve got interesting thoughts or working on something related to this, I’d love to [get in touch](mailto:alex@lxvdo.com)!
