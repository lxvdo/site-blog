![picture of first contact]()
Hello there. 
It is me, Alex van Domburg.
Communication to you from the other side of the screen.
its wonderful that nowadays, it is more easy than ever to communicate (of ander woord) with anyone in the world.
Research on the other hand is increasingly showing that we are more disconnected than ever in recorded history. 

Why is this?

These technologies are influencing people more intensively. 
with both traditional and social media focussed on exposure followers likes and other metrics, the one who shouts the loudest wins.
The loudest, bringing most attention, plays into our senses of getting that said attention. Using bright alarming colors and sounds, playing into our fears, anxieties and desire for safety. 

It generates money, but is destroying our world in the long term. 

People have become complacent, living their routines of work, sports, uitgaan, shopping, experiences and holidays. a lifestyle purpotrayed through the picture perfection displayed on our social media,
only showing the highlights and nog the normal and the lows.  
Everything based on instant gratification and consumption.
Companies want us to be consuming, governments want us to be consuming
Our environment on the other hand is screaming, but we cannot hear it because we stick our heads in the sand and forgot how to listen.   


in the past few years i have more and more been reading and thinking about the world.
what is normal, why do i choose a certain thing instead of the other? 
from a young age a path is set out for your, from primary to secondary school to high school to university to working life as an employee.
Did I choose this myself? Or is this something that is imprinted on me from a young age. Be a working cog in the larger machine the human society, and dont question the status quo. 
Am I not grateful for the privileged life I'm living? 


Changing things is hard, deviating from the norm is hard, real working is hard, creating is hard. 
I have come to understand that however, the hardest journey often is most interesting to venture on and brings the most meaningful rewards. 

therefore
i want to create more
to think more
to consume less
and to be more conscientious about how i impact the people and environment around me
I want to live in balance

creating stuff is scary, is hard, but in my opinion is essential human trait
we adapt and utilize our environments in steeds new ways, and share our experiences and lessons in stories with the people around us.

where does this fear stem from ? [link to article medium fears]()
the need to be perfect, the opinion other people have about me, 

These mental constructs are irrational, and can be easily reframed and weggerationaliseerd.   

I like Yoda's famous mantra:
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/ArrVyXcjSzzxe/giphy.gif)
On the surface, this refers to having faith, or trust/self confidence. 

However, I also have started this applying to reframing my personal goals in life. 
I interpret this not just as faith in yourself, but also in reframing your goals to system thinking: processes and habits.
Don't outsource your goals and successes, but make them for yourself to achieve.
Create your own definition of success. 
Breaking those goals up in pieces and taking one step at a time. 

Step one complete
step two here I come
