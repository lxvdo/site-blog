Title 2: Creating to connect

intro - we are being disconnected
why is this?
- economy exploiting people
- human comfort and gratification
- insecurities and fear
what do i want to do to combat these -> making digital interaction more human -> focus on sharing stories and creating conscious
- create more
creating stories is scary: sharing is showing vulnerability and fearing
- reframing fear by reframing success

I find it wonderful that nowadays it is so easy to communicate with anyone in the world.
On the other hand, I see that the same technologies are disconnecting us from each other more than ever before [(and research is showing it as well)](). 
What is happening here?

One of the obvious contributors of this is the digital economy, with its unrestricted desire for growth in size and profits. 
As data and information are becoming the world's most valuable resources (easily surpassing oil if you look at the world's largest companies),
people are becoming online cash cows??. not only when they are working but even more when they are not (and relaxing).
It generates money, but is destroying our world in the long term. 

These technologies are influencing people more intensively. 
with both traditional and social media focussed on exposure followers likes and other metrics, the one who shouts the loudest gets the most attention. and therefore often wins
The loudest, bringing most attention, plays into our senses of getting that said attention. Using bright alarming colors and sounds, playing into our fears, anxieties and desire for safety. 

People have become complacent, living their routines of work, sports, uitgaan, shopping, experiences and holidays. a lifestyle purpetred through the picture perfection displayed on our social media,
only showing the highlights and nog the normal and the lows.  
Everything based on instant gratification and consumption.
Companies want us to be consuming, governments want us to be consuming
Our environment on the other hand is screaming, but we cannot hear it because we stick our heads in the sand and forgot how to listen.   

Changing things is hard, deviating from the norm is hard, real working is hard, creating is hard. 
I have come to understand that however, the hardest journey often is most interesting to venture on and brings the most meaningful rewards. 

Therefore:
I want to be more conscious
I want to think more
I want to create more
I want to consume less
I want to live in balance

creating stuff is scary, is hard, but in my opinion is essential human trait
As humans we adapt, we utilize our environments in surprising ways, and we share our experiences and lessons in stories with the people around us.

where does this fear stem from ? [link to article medium fears]()
the need to be perfect, the opinion other people have about me, scared to be unoriginal, wrong or offensive

These mental constructs are irrational, and can be easily reframed and weggerationaliseerd.   

I like Yoda's famous mantra:
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/ArrVyXcjSzzxe/giphy.gif)
On the surface, it can refer to having faith, becoming self-confident and showing commitment.  
Taking it a step further, 
However, I also have started this applying to reframing my personal goals in life. 
I interpret this not just as faith in yourself, but also in reframing your goals to system thinking: processes and habits.
Don't outsource your goals and successes, but make them for yourself to achieve.
Create your own definition of success. 
Breaking those goals up in pieces and taking one step at a time. 

In my writing, I am going to explore how we can cope with the noise that is entering our lives on a daily basis. How can we shield ourselves and how can we apply technology in positive ways to 
gain some peace of mind, start improving our lives and improving the environment around us at the same time.
